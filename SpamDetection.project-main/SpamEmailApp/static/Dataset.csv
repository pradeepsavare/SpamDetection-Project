Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and they're not all in /etc either... > Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult & > complicated as possible ;--) Yup... In this case, I had two issues. 1. I mirrored the disk to give to someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2 processor. 2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware related. Again, it's also an interesting exercise... > Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious > hassle down the line. Oh, I'm doing that too. This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit! I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise) I'm also going for a backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org . The admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

I think that's simply because Sylpheed isn't a GNOME application, but a ""simple"" gtk+ one. It needs no GNOME libs at all, so upgrading to GNOME 2 but keeping gtk+ 1.2 will let you keep Sylpheed with no problem.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote it up. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other ""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress!

Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do so, practically essential. Then they explain how: ""Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,"" said Joel Joves, a designer with offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. ""If you have a fabulous study or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a room.""

Those that say 73/72 at the end work, though. I just installed gnome-terminal and I'm impressed by that. I have seom gtk1 apps to rebuild and put into my own repository (like gaim) so I didn't do the full session install. Besides, it's HUGE. And it wants to install stuff like kudzu and parted and who knows what. What's wrong with dynamic configuration? Dependency hell indeed. -- > wd0: 1671040 partitions found That's a lie.

As a pointer occupies the natural word size (32 bits or 64bits), no wonder you get 4*1024 (sizeof(char *) * numer_of_elements). > int len = sizeof(testbuff); > cout << len << ""\n""; > return 0; > } > using "" int len = sizeof((char*)testbuff); "" sizeof returns the size of types. You can use it with vars (and then the normal form is sizeof var, not sizeof(var)), but if you're changing the type with the var with a cast, of course you'll get the size of that new type.

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one. Want to find out more about PGP? <http://www.uk.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/> You can get the software from: PGPfreeware <http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgp/versions/freeware/> GnuPG (GPG) <http://www.pgpi.org/download/gnupg/> Bring the following: * Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity) * A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key. Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

NO, there is no catch; just send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom. Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then people send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for me. And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL. Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you must have missed something.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!"" With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT."" Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. Here is the basic version of what you need to do: Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That's the key. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! -Sincerely, Jonathan Rourke P.S. Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER."" The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to ""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that. You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK"" and ""JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! ""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do. 1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't have them). * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem). *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! * When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a"" through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing of available reports. b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,. 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. Here are two primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about level five! That's $500,000 alone! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that and more! REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)....... $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) ....... $50,000 5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) ....... $500,000 THIS TOTALS - $555,550 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants. THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! AVAILABLE REPORTS *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME *** * ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT) On one of those sheets of paper include: (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems). PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: REPORT #1 ""The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #1 FROM: Tony Goon 120 - 8511 Westminster Hwy. Richmond, BC. V6X 3H7 CANADA REPORT #2 ""The Insiders Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #2 FROM: Julie Lind Blk B 5-15,Prisma Perdana, Jalan Midah 8 A,Cheras 56000 Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA. REPORT #3 ""The Secrets to Multilevel Marketing on the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #3 FROM: Mike IAT PO Box 11360, 50742 Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA. REPORT #4 'How to become a Millionaire utilizing the Power of Multilevel Marketing and the Internet"" ORDER REPORT #4 FROM: Ken Leung Flat B, 5/F, BLK 5, Serenity Park, Tai Po, N.T. Hong Kong REPORT #5 ""How to Send One Million E-Mails for Free."" ORDER REPORT #5 FROM: Randy Dallard P.O. Box 8 Osprey, FL 34229 U.S.A. About 50,000 new people get online every month! ******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* * TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment? Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when they email you, send them this report in response! If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business! Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program, answer one question ... DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look at the following facts about this program: 1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE! 2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO ADVERTISE! 4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE WORLD! 5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS YOUR TIME! 6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! 7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. ******* TESTIMONIALS******* This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. -Charles Morris, Esq. Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the first try!! -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending! -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! Take 5 minutes to Change Your Future!

Good question. This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very late 80's or early 90's. It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target. In trying to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to 70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story. The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona (famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela sticks in my mind but I can't be certain. http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html -- Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com ""Computers are useless.

Some might overlap; the manual process for passing a message through might require the assertion of a legally-enforceable guarantee about the messages' contents. Passing certain tests once might add an address to the persistent whitelist. Any slightly determined and legitimate correspondent would be able to find multiple ways to get their mail read, while spammers would face a situation where the marginal cost of reaching me is much, much greater than the expected return. Some economically irrational spammers (and religious/political zealots) would get through, but such traffic should be a background trickle rather than an annoying torrent. - Gordon http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0
