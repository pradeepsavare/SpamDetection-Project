My uneducated guess is that all they need to >jump expensive whitelist >walls would be buckshot a spam-laden Klez .. There are several issues here. (1) For reasons that have nothing to do with commercial advertising, we need email software that prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We simply can't continue down the path where every script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can cause millions or billions of dollars worth of damage. (2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the point that digital signatures are the standard way to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging your machine or otherwise compromising your private key will be the only way that someone can forge a message from you. I don't see any reason that email software that automatically uses digital signatures for contact management and whitelisting would be any more expensive than existing email clients. Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly on it. (3) I think identity theft should be made a felony, with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand, I think using a virus to compromise someone else's private key should should fall into that category. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork"

Apparently, yes. Though for me it did suggest all sorts of creepy stuff. After installing packages one by one and removing some old stuff and whatnot, the original gnome-session from there suddenly no longer wanted parted and all that. Go figure. > Also Gaim doesn't work with GNOME 2.0 just yet? If you strip out the gnome stuff, it still runs as a Gtk app without the applet. Maybe you can even leave in the old panel and all that but I think some files will conflict and have to be overridden with --replace-files (dangerous). I just rebuilt gaim and made a few changes to the .spec adding --without-gnome to %configure or such. It might be nice to separate the panel version from the actual program like debian does. Also, bubblemon no longer compiled for me and Yelp had some broken dependency there. -- If you only want to go 500 miles, can you begin with a halfstep? _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net> http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list"
